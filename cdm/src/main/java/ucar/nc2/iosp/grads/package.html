  I/O Service Provider for GrADS Binary Grid Files.  This IOSP handles:
  <ul>
  <li> raw lat/lon binary grid files (DTYPE not defined)
  <li> ensembles defined by NAMES in one file or as a template
  <li> time templates
  <li> gaussian latitudes
  </ul>

  It does not yet handle:
  <ul>
  <li> other DTYPEs since these are readable through other IOSPs
  <li> projected data (has PDEF)
  <li> cross-sections since there isn't enough metadata to define the
       single x or y dimension
  <li> ensembles defined by EDEF/ENDEDEF
  <li> some miscellaneous options:
       <ul>
       <li><b>zrev</b> - no examples
       <li><b>365_day_calendar</b> - no support in netCDF-Java for imaginary times
       <li><b>byteswapped</b> - no examples, bad way to do it
       <li><b>cray_32bit_ieee</b> - no examples
       </ul>
