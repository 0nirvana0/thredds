Scientific data type "Grid", uses cartesian coordinate system.
<p> Deprecated - use ucar.nc2.ft2.coverage</p>
<p> A <b><i>grid</i></b> has 
  a georeferencing &quot;gridded&quot; CoordinateSystem, which implies a connected 
  topology such that values next to each other in index space are next to each 
  other in coordinate space. In the VisAD data model, a grid is a sampled Field. 
  <i> <b>Note: these classes should be considered experimental and may be refactored
