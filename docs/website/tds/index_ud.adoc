Unidata embarks on link:/projects/[new projects] to help make its data
and tools available to a broader, more diverse audience. The following
are a list of THREDDS Data Server-related projects between the Unidata
Program Center and external collaborators.

===== <</projects/index.adoc#cdm,Common Data Model>>

image:/images/logos/cdm_only-75x75.png[Common Data Model] Unidata’s
link:/software/netcdf-java/CDM/[Common Data Model]
(link:/software/netcdf-java/CDM/[CDM]) is an abstract data model for
scientific datasets. It merges the link:/software/netcdf/[netCDF],
http://www.opendap.org/[OPeNDAP], and
http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/[HDF5] data models to create a
common API for many types of scientific data. The NetCDF Java library is
an implementation of the CDM which can read many
<</software/netcdf-java/index.adoc#formats,file formats>> besides
netCDF.
