THREDDS Catalogs
================

= THREDDS Catalogs

'''''

THREDDS Catalogs are logical directories of on-line data resources,
encoded as http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/[XML documents], which provide a
place for annotations and other metadata about the data resources to
reside. This is how THREDDS-enabled data consumers find out what data is
available from data providers.

THREDDS Catalogs were originally designed for __client__s to use to
access remote data. They have been extended to allow the TDS to use them
for its own configuration. In this mode they are called __*TDS
Configuration Catalog*__**_g_**_*s, or server-side Catalogs.*_ They
contain information needed only on the server, which is removed when the
TDS sends the catalog to the client, called the _*client-side*_ or
__*client-view catalog*__.

For client-side catalogs, see:

* The link:InvCatalogSpec.html[Catalog specification] is an annotated
XML Schema that explains the details of THREDDS Catalogs.
* The XML Schema document:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/schemas/thredds/InvCatalog.1.0.7.xsd[Online
catalog schema].
* link:../tutorial/CatalogPrimer.html[Catalog Primer]
* The link:../../netcdf-java/documentation.htm[Java NetCDF library] has
a complete package (thredds.client.catalog) to parse client-side
catalogs.
* link:#addLatest_Element[Syphon] is a python library that includdes
catalog parsing.

The TDS dynamically generates THREDDS catalogs based on the TDS
configuration catalogs. For server-side catalogs, see:

Tutorial]
