=== Aggregation, PointFeature Collections

Constructing an aggregation/collection involves scanning all the files
in one or more directories.

We typically want to associate with each file the list of coordinate
values along the aggregation dimension.

For PointFeature Collections, we need to know the time range for each
file.

=== TDS Catalogs

Dynamic generation of catalogs with DatasetScan involves scanning all
the files in one or more directories.

We can open files open in a background thread and add discovery metadata
automatically.

== Design

=== filesystem.CacheManager (ehcache)

* keep track of files on disk
* list of all files for directoryName
* request -> get in cache, re

cache key = directoryName, value = serializable object

cache value = list of fileNames for each file in directory.
