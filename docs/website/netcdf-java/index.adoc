image:/img/v3/logos/netcdfjava-50x50.png[NetCDF Java] The NetCDF Java
library implements the link:CDM/index.html[Common Data Model] (CDM) to
interface netCDF files and other types of scientific data formats.

= Unidata Projects Involving the NetCDF Java

Unidata embarks on link:/projects/[new projects] to help make its data
and tools available to a broader, more diverse audience. The following
are a list of NetCDF Java-related projects between the Unidata Program
Center and external collaborators.

===== link:/projects/index.html#cdm[Common Data Model]

image:/img/v3/logos/cdm-75x75.png[Common Data Model] Unidata’s
link:CDM/[Common Data Model] (link:CDM/[CDM]) is an abstract data model
for scientific datasets. It merges the link:/software/netcdf/[netCDF],
http://www.opendap.org/[OPeNDAP], and
http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/[HDF5] data models to create a
common API for many types of scientific data. The NetCDF Java library is
an implementation of the CDM which can read many
link:index.html#formats[file formats] besides netCDF.
