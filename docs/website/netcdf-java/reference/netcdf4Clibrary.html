<h1>NetCDF-4 C Library Loading</h1>
<p>In order to write NetCDF-4 files, you must have the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF-4 C library</a>, version
  4.3.1 or above, compiled and available on your system, along with all supporting libraries (HDF5, etc). The details of this differ for each operating system, and
  our experience (so far) is documented below.</p>

<p>The libraries must be in a directory that the operating system knows to look in, and the CDM needs to know the NetCDF-4 library
  name.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For TDS users, we recommend setting the library path and name in
    <em><a href="../../tds/reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html#netcdfCLibrary">threddsConfig.xml.</a></em></li>
  <li>For stand-alone CDM library use, you can 
    <ol>
      <li>put the  library path in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unix) or PATH (windows)</li>
      <li>set a system property on the startup line: <strong>-Djna.library.path=<em>/path/to/library</em></strong></li>
      <li>set the library path and name in the <em><a href="RuntimeLoading.html#XML">RuntimeConfiguration</a></em> file</li>
      <li>directly call <strong>ucar.nc2.jni.netcdf.Nc4Iosp.setLibraryAndPath</strong>()</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly recommend using 64-bit Java. In any case, use the
  lastest update for Java, because security improvements are constantly being made.</p>

<h2>A Note on HDF5</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When building HDF5, you <strong>must</strong> do so with both <em> --enable-threadsafe </em>and<em> --with-pthread=DIR</em> options</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the <em>--with-pthread</em> option must point to the directory that contains the POSIX Threads library install (<em>[DIR]</em>/includes/pthread.h, <em>[DIR]</em>/lib/libpthread*)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>For more information, please see the HDF5 <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf5-quest.html#mthread">FAQ</a>.
</ul>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<ol>
  <li>We strongly recommend using the 64-bit Windows version and a 64-bit JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</li>
  <li>Get the pre-built windows binaries from <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/win_netcdf/">here</a>. (Power users are welcome to build
    them - but Java needs DLLs to load).
  </li>
  <li>Run the install.exe file, which puts everything from the <em>bin</em> and <em>deps</em> directories into a standard directory, which should be accesible
    to anyone who wants to use the NetCDF-4 C library.
  </li>
  <li>Add the install directory to the Windows System Variable Path.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the latest NetCDF-4 C library release from <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp">here. </a></li>
  <li>Compile the library. See <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/building.html"> instructions.</a></li>
  <li>Set the <em>library path</em> to the directory where the libraries were built  and the library name to <strong><em>netcdf</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you get a message like this:</p>
<pre>
 Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error***
 The HDF5 header files used to compile this application do not match
 the version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked.
 Data corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application continues.
 This can happen when an application was compiled by one version of HDF5 but
 linked with a different version of static or shared HDF5 library.
 You should recompile the application or check your shared library related
 settings such as 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
 You can, at your own risk, disable this warning by setting the environment
 variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
 Setting it to 2 or higher will suppress the warning messages totally.
 Headers are 1.8.10, library is 1.8.5
 Bye...
</pre>
<p>Make sure that you dont have an old version of the HDF5 library in your PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>

<h2><a name="writing" id="writing">Writing NetCDF-4 files</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>From the command line: see <a href="manPages.html#nccopy">nccopy man page</a></li>
  <li>From ToolsUI: in <strong>Viewer</strong> tab, bring up the file to copy, then click &quot;Write netCDF file&quot; button to get dialog.</li>
  <li>From TDS NetCDF Subset Service: choose <strong>netcdf-4</strong> output type.</li>
  <li>From a Java program (see <em>ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.main()</em> for complete example) :
<pre>Nc4Chunking chunker = Nc4Chunking factory(Strategy type, int deflateLevel, boolean shuffle);
NetcdfFileWriter.Version version = NetcdfFileWriter.Version.netcdf4;

FileWriter2 writer = new ucar.nc2.FileWriter2(ncfileIn, filenameOut, version, chunker);
...
NetcdfFile ncfileOut = writer.write();
ncfileIn.close();<br/>ncfileOut.close();
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Chunking Strategy (version 4.5)</h3>
<p>When writing NetCDF-4 files, one must decide on how the variables are to be chunked. In the NetCDF-Java library this is done through the use of a Nc4Chunking strategy. The possibilities currently are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>standard</strong> : this strategy is used by default (see below for description) </li>
  <li><strong>grib</strong>: this strategy matches how GRIB files are stored: the chunking uses only the two rightmost dimensions, which for GRIB is the x and y dimension. Use this strategy when converting GRIB files to NetCDF-4, in order to optimize conversion writing time, and to get similar access speed.</li>
  <li><strong>custom</strong>: you may write your own inplementation of <strong>ucar.nc2.write.Nc4Chunking</strong> and pass it into <strong>FileWriter2</strong> or <strong>NetcdfFileWriter</strong>. This gives you complete control over chunking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>grib</strong> strategies allow you to override individual variable chunking if you want by setting the variable's <strong>_ChunkSizes </strong>attribute. </p>
<p><strong>By default, the Java library will write chunked and compressed NetCDF-4 files</strong>, using the default chunking algorithm. You may pass in a null for the chunking parameter to use the default.</p>
<h3><a name="chunking" id="chunking">Default chunking strategy</a></h3>

  <p>For each Variable:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Look for a variable attribute named &quot;<strong>_ChunkSizes&quot;</strong>, whose value is a vector of integer chunk sizes, one for each dimension. If it
      exists, use it.
    </li>
    <li>If the variable does not have an unlimited dimension: 
      <ul>
        <li> it will be chunked if the total size in bytes &gt; <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minVariableSize</strong></li>
        <li>chunk size will be <em><strong>fillFastest</strong></em><strong></strong>( variable.shape, <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize</strong>)  </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the variable has one or more unlimited dimensions, it will be chunked, and the chunk size will be calculated as:    
      <ol>
        <li>set unlimited dimensions to length one, then compute  <em><strong>fillFastest</strong></em><strong></strong>( variable.shape, <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize</strong>)</li>
        <li>if the resulting chunk size is greater than <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize</strong>, use it</li>
        <li>if not, set the  unlimited dimension chunk sizes so that the resulting chunksize is close to <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize. </strong>If there are N unlimited dimensions, take the Nth root, ie evenly divide the chunk size among the unlimited dimensions. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <em><strong>fillFastest</strong></em><strong></strong>( int[] shape,<strong> maxSize</strong>) algorithm fills the fastest varying (rightmost) dimensions first, until the chunkSize is as close to <strong>maxSize</strong> as possible without exceeding. The net effect is that the chunkSizes will be close to <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize</strong>, with a minimum of <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize</strong>, and favoring read access along the fast dimensions. Any variable with an unlimited dimension will use at least <strong>Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize</strong> bytes (approx, but if compressing, unused space should be mostly eliminated).</p>
  <p>Current default values (these can be overidden by the user):</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>minVariableSize</strong> = 65K</li>
    <li><strong>defaultChunkSize</strong> = 256K</li>
    <li><strong>minChunksize</strong> = 8K</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By default, compression (deflate level = 5) and the shuffle filter will be used. The user can  override these by:</p>

<pre>
// set deflate &gt; 0 to compress
// set shuffle to true for the shuffle filter 
Nc4Chunking chunker = Nc4Chunking factory(Nc4Chunking.Strategy.standard, int deflateLevel, boolean shuffle);
