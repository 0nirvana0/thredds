= NetCDF-4 C library

In order to write NetCDF-4 files, you must have the
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[NetCDF-4 C
library]—version 4.3.1 or above—available on your system, along with all
supporting libraries (HDF5, zlib, etc). The details of this differ for
each operating system, and our experience (so far) is documented below.

== Installation

For all platforms, we strongly recommend 64-bit Java, if you can run it.
Also, be sure to use the latest version, as security improvements are
constantly being made.

=== Windows

The simplest option is to download and install one of the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html[pre-built
binaries]. If you’re feeling intrepid, it’s also possible to
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html#netCDF-CMake[build
from source].

=== Linux

The easiest way to get NetCDF is through a package management program,
such as rpm, yum, adept, and others. Details will vary with each program
but "netcdf" is usually the package name you want. Of course, it’s
also possible to build from source, as described
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html[here].

==== A note on HDF5

When building HDF5, you *must* do so with both the `--enable-threadsafe`
and `--with-pthread=DIR` options. The `--with-pthread` option must point
to the directory that contains the POSIX Threads library install
([DIR]/includes/pthread.h, [DIR]/lib/libpthread). For more
information, please see the http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf5-quest.html#mthread[HDF5 FAQ].

=== Mac

The installation process is hopefully similar to Linux.
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/help/MailArchives/netcdf/msg11807.html[Here]
is a support question that may be useful.

== Loading

In order to use NetCDF-4, the CDM must know the location of the
"netcdf" shared library, as well as the location(s) of its
dependencies. These files will have different extensions depending on
your platform:

* On Windows, they will be .DLL files.
* On Linux, they will be .SO files.
* On Mac, they will be .DYLIB files.

There are several ways to specify their locations.

=== Preferred method (requires NetCDF-Java 4.5.4 or later)

Set the system library path. This is the path that the OS will search
whenever it needs to find a shared library that it doesn’t already know
the location of. It is not Java-, NetCDF-, or CDM-specific. As usual,
details will vary with each platform.

==== Windows

The system library path maps to the `PATH` environment variable. To find
NetCDF-4 and its dependencies, you’ll want to add
`$NC4_INSTALL_DIR/bin`, `$NC4_INSTALL_DIR/deps/$ARCH/bin`, and
`$NC4_INSTALL_DIR/deps/$ARCH/lib` to the `PATH` variable.
`NC4_INSTALL_DIR` is the location where you installed the C library and
`ARCH` is its architecture (either "w32" or "x64").

==== Linux

The system library path maps to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
variable. If you used the default installation directory when building,
NetCDF-4 and its dependencies will all be in `/usr/local/lib`. If you
got NetCDF from a package manager, it’ll likely have been installed
elsewhere.

==== Mac

The system library path maps to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. If you use Homebrew or MacPorts to install netCDF-4, netCDF-Java will check their default installation directories automatically (`/usr/local/lib/` and `/opt/local/lib/`, respectively).

=== Alternate methods

The following alternatives are Java- and/or CDM-specific. To use these,
**it is required that NetCDF and all of its dependencies live in the
same directory**. So, if that is not the case in your current
configuration, you must manually copy them all to the same place. This
is a particular issue on Windows, because the libraries are guaranteed
to be in separate locations by default.

In addition to the library path, the CDM also needs to know the library
name. This is almost always "netcdf", unless you’ve renamed it.

* For TDS users, we recommend setting the library path and name in the
<<../../tds/reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile#netcdfCLibrary,THREDDS
configuration file>>.
* For standalone CDM library use, you can
** create a system environment variable: `JNA_PATH=/path/to/library`
** set a Java property on the command line:
`-Djna.library.path=/path/to/library`
** set the library path and name in the
<<RuntimeLoading#XML,runtime configuration file>>
** directly call
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/javadocAll/ucar/nc2/jni/netcdf/Nc4Iosp.html#setLibraryAndPath(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)[Nc4Iosp.setLibraryAndPath()]
from your Java program

In all cases, it is recommended that you use an absolute path to specify the library location.

=== Troubleshooting

If you get a message like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Warning! ***HDF5 library version mismatched error***
 The HDF5 header files used to compile this application do not match
 the version used by the HDF5 library to which this application is linked.
 Data corruption or segmentation faults may occur if the application continues.
 This can happen when an application was compiled by one version of HDF5 but
 linked with a different version of static or shared HDF5 library.
 You should recompile the application or check your shared library related
 settings such as 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.
 You can, at your own risk, disable this warning by setting the environment
 variable 'HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK' to a value of '1'.
 Setting it to 2 or higher will suppress the warning messages totally.
 Headers are 1.8.10, library is 1.8.5
 Bye...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that you don’t have an old version of the HDF5 library in your
system library path.

== Writing NetCDF-4 files

* From the command line: see <<manPages#nccopy,nccopy man page>>
* From ToolsUI: in *Viewer* tab, bring up the file to copy, then click
"Write netCDF file" button to get dialog.
* From TDS NetCDF Subset Service: choose *netcdf-4* output type.
* From a Java program (see _ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.main()_ for complete example) :
+
[source,java]
----
Nc4Chunking chunker = Nc4Chunking factory(Strategy type, int deflateLevel, boolean shuffle);
NetcdfFileWriter.Version version = NetcdfFileWriter.Version.netcdf4;

FileWriter2 writer = new ucar.nc2.FileWriter2(ncfileIn, filenameOut, version, chunker);
...
NetcdfFile ncfileOut = writer.write();
ncfileIn.close();
ncfileOut.close();
----

=== Chunking Strategy (version 4.5)

When writing NetCDF-4 files, one must decide on how the variables are to
be chunked. In the NetCDF-Java library this is done through the use of a
Nc4Chunking strategy. The possibilities currently are:

* *standard* : this strategy is used by default (see below for
description)
* **grib**: this strategy matches how GRIB files are stored: the
chunking uses only the two rightmost dimensions, which for GRIB is the x
and y dimension. Use this strategy when converting GRIB files to
NetCDF-4, in order to optimize conversion writing time, and to get
similar access speed.
* **custom**: you may write your own inplementation of
*ucar.nc2.write.Nc4Chunking* and pass it into *FileWriter2* or
**NetcdfFileWriter**. This gives you complete control over chunking.

Both *standard* and *grib* strategies allow you to override individual
variable chunking if you want by setting the variable’s *_ChunkSizes*
attribute.

**By default, the Java library will write chunked and compressed
NetCDF-4 files**, using the default chunking algorithm. You may pass in
a null for the chunking parameter to use the default.

=== Default chunking strategy

For each Variable:

.  Look for a variable attribute named *_ChunkSizes_*, whose value is a vector of integer chunk sizes, one for each dimension. If it exists, use it.
.  If the variable does not have an unlimited dimension:
.. it will be chunked if the total size in bytes > *Nc4ChunkingDefault.minVariableSize*
.. chunk size will be _FillFastest( variable.shape, Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize)_
.  If the variable has one or more unlimited dimensions, it will be chunked, and the chunk size will be calculated as:
..  set unlimited dimensions to length one, then compute _FillFastest( variable.shape, Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize)_
..  if the resulting chunk size is greater than *Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize*, use it
..  if not, set the unlimited dimension chunk sizes so that the resulting chunksize is close to *Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize.*
If there are N unlimited dimensions, take the Nth root, ie evenly divide the chunk size among the unlimited dimensions.

The *_FillFastest( int[] shape, maxSize)_* algorithm fills the fastest varying (rightmost) dimensions first, until the chunkSize is as
close to *maxSize* as possible without exceeding.
The net effect is that the chunkSizes will be close to *Nc4ChunkingDefault.defaultChunkSize*,
with a minimum of *Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize*, and favoring read access along the fast dimensions.
Any variable with an unlimited dimension will use at least *Nc4ChunkingDefault.minChunksize* bytes
(approx), although if compressing, unused space should be mostly eliminated.

Current default values (these can be overidden by the user):

* *minVariableSize* = 65K
* *defaultChunkSize* = 256K
* *minChunksize* = 8K

By default, compression (deflate level = 5) and the shuffle filter will be used. The user can override these by:

[source,java]
----
// set deflate > 0 to compress
// set shuffle to true for the shuffle filter 
Nc4Chunking chunker = Nc4Chunking factory(Nc4Chunking.Strategy.standard, int deflateLevel, boolean shuffle);
