Dataset URLs
============

= Dataset URLs

The netCDF-Java library can read _*datasets*_ from a variety of sources.
The dataset is named using a Uniform Resource Location (__*URL*__). This
page summarizes the netCDF-Java API use of URLs.

== ucar.nc2.NetcdfFile.open(String location)

=== 1. Local Files

NetcdfFile can work with __*local files*__, e.g:

* _*/usr/share/data/model.nc*_
* _*file:/usr/share/data/model.nc*_
* _*file:C:/share/data/model.nc*_ *(NOTE we advise using forward slashes
everywhere, including Windows)*
* _*data/model.nc*_ (relative to the current working directory)

When using a file location that has an embedded `:' char, eg
__*C:/share/data/model.nc*__, its a good idea to add the file: prefix,
to prevent the `C:' from being misinterpreted as a URL schema.

=== 2. HTTP Remote Files

NetcdfFile can open __*HTTP remote files*__,
link:HTTPservice.html[served over HTTP], for example:

* _*http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/testdata/mydata1.nc*_

The HTTP server must implement the *getRange* header. Performance will
be strongly affected by file format and the data access pattern.

The local or remote file must be link:formats/FileTypes.html[one of the
formats that the netCDF-Java library can read]. We call this set of
files Common Data Model files, (or _*CDM files*_ for short), to make
clear that the NetCDF-Java library is not limited to netCDF files.

If the URL ends with a with ``.Z'', ``.zip'', ``.gzip'', ``.gz'', or
``.bz2'', the file is assumed to be __*compressed*__. The netCDF-Java
library will uncompress/unzip and write a new file without the suffix,
then read from the uncompressed file. Generally it prefers to place the
uncompressed file in the same directory as the original file. If it does
not have write permission on that directory, it will use the
link:Caching.html[cache directory] defined by *ucar.nc2.util.DiskCache.*

 

== ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.openFile(String location)

NetcdfDataset.openDataset() simply calls a NetcdfDataset.openFile(),
then optionally enhances the dataset.

NetcdfDataset.openFile can open the same URLs that NetcdfFile can open,
plus the following:

=== 1. OPeNDAP datasets

NetcdfDataset can open _*OPeNDAP*_ datasets, which use a _dods:_ or
_http:_ prefix, for example:

* _*http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/fmrc/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_95km/files/GFS_CONUS_95km_20070319_0600.grib1*_
* _*dods://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/models/NCEP/GFS/Global_5x2p5deg/GFS_Global_5x2p5deg_20070313_1200.nc*_

To avoid confusion with remote HTTP files, OPeNDAP URLs are often
converted to use the __dods__: prefix. Also note that when passing an
OPeNDAP dataset URL to the netCDF-Java library, do not include any of
the access suffixes, e.g. __.dods, .ascii, .dds__, etc.

Theres an ambiguity as to whether _*http://server/something*_ is an
OPeNDAP or an HTTP remote file using range requests. There will be more
ambiguities in the future, as other HTTP based protocols are added.
Currently we do a HEAD request on __*http://server/something.dds*__, and
if it succeeds, and returns a header  Content-Description=``dods-dds''
or ``dods_dds'', then we open as OPeNDAP, and if it fails we try opening
as an HTTP file.

=== 2. NcML datasets

NetcdfDataset can open _*NcML*_ datasets, which may be local or remote,
and must end with a _.xml_ or _.ncml_ suffix, for example:

* _*/usr/share/data/model.ncml*_
* _*file:/usr/share/data/model.ncml*_
* _*http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/testdata/mydata1.xml*_

Because xml is so widely used, we recommend using the _.ncml_ suffix
when possible.

=== 3. THREDDS Datasets

NetcdfDataset can open _*THREDDS*_ datasets, which are contained in
THREDDS Catalogs. The general form is
**_thredds_**__:catalogURL#dataset_id ,__ where _catalogURL_ is the URL
of a THREDDS catalog, and _dataset_id_ is the ID of a dataset inside of
that catalog. The _thredds:_ prefix ensures that it is understood as a
THREDDS dataset. Example:

* _*thredds:http://localhost:8080/test/addeStationDataset.xml#surfaceHourly*_
* _*thredds:file:c:/dev/netcdf-java-2.2/test/data/catalog/addeStationDataset.xml#AddeSurfaceData*_

In the first case, _*http://localhost:8080/test/addeStationDataset.xml*_
must be a catalog containing a dataset with ID __*surfaceHourly*__. The
second case will open a catalog stored at
_*c:/dev/netcdf-java-2.2/test/data/catalog/addeStationDataset.xml*_ and
look for a dataset with ID __*AddeSurfaceData*__.

NetcdfDataset will examine the dataset and extract the dataset URL and
open it and return a NetcdfDataset. (If there are more than one
**_dataset access URL_**, it will choose a service that it understands
the best, like OPeNDAP). The dataset metadata in the THREDDS catalog may
be used to augment the metadata of the NetcdfDataset.

=== 4. THREDDS Resolver Datasets

NetcdfDataset can open _*THREDDS*_ _*Resolver*_ datasets, which have the
form **_thredds:resolve:resolverURL_**. In this case it expects that the
*_resolverURL_* will return a catalog with a single top level dataset,
which is the target dataset. Example:

* _thredds:resolve:http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/model/NCEP/NAM/CONUS_12km/latest.xml_

In this case,
*_http://motherlode.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/dodsC/model/NCEP/NAM/CONUS_12km/latest.xml_*
returns a catalog contining the latest dataset in the
*_NCEP/NAM/CONUS_12km_* collection. NetcdfDataset will read the catalog,
extract the THREDDS dataset, and open it as in section 3 above.

=== 5. CdmRemote Datasets

NetcdfDataset can open _*link:stream/CdmRemote.html[CDM Remote]*_
datasets, which have the form
**_cdmremote:http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc_**. In this
case it expects that the URL is an endpoint for a cdmremote web service,
which provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets. This is an
experimental web service.

=== 6. DAP4 datasets

NetcdfDataset can open datasets through the _*DAP4*_ protocol. The url
should either begin with _dap4:_ or _dap4:http(s):_ Example might
include the following.

* _*dap4:http://thredds.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/fmrc/NCEP/GFS/CONUS_95km/files/GFS_CONUS_95km_20070319_0600.grib1*_
* _*dap4://thredds.ucar.edu:8080/thredds/models/NCEP/GFS/Global_5x2p5deg/GFS_Global_5x2p5deg_20070313_1200.nc*_

To avoid confusion with remote HTTP files, DAP4 URLs are often converted
to use the __dap4__: prefix. Also note that when passing a DAP4 dataset
URL to the netCDF-Java library, do not include any of the access
suffixes, e.g. __.dmr, .dap, .dst__, etc.

== ucar.nc2.ft.FeatureDatasetFactoryManager.open()

A FeatureDatasetFactory creates
link:FeatureDatasets/Overview.html[Scientific Feature Type
Datasets]link:FeatureDatasets/Overview.html[] such as GridDatasets,
PointFeatureDatasets, RadialDatasetSweep, etc. These may be based on
local files, or they may use remote access protocols.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*ucar.nc2.ft.FeatureDatasetFactoryManager.open(FeatureType
wantFeatureType, String location, CancelTask task, Formatter errlog) +
*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager.open() looks for a FeatureDatasetFactory
that knows how to create a FeatureDataset from the named location. If
the _wantFeatureType_ parameter is not null, it will only look for
factories that return that type.

_FeatureDatasetFactoryManager_ can open the same URLs that NetcdfDataset
and NetcdfFile can open, plus the following:

=== 1. *CdmRemote Feature Datasets*

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager can open
__**link:stream/CdmRemote.html[CdmRemote Feature
Datase]**link:stream/CdmRemote.html[*ts*]__, which have the form
**_cdmremote:http://server:8080/thredds/cdmremote/data.nc_**. In this
case it expects that the URL is an endpoint for a cdmremote feature
dataset web service, which provides coordinate subsetting on remote
_*Feature Type*_ datasets. This is an experimental web service.

=== 2. Collection Datasets

FeatureDatasetFactoryManager can open collections of datasets specified
with a
link:../../tds/reference/collections/CollectionSpecification.html[collection
specification string], which has the form __*collection:spec*__, and
calls *CompositeDatasetFactory.factory(wantFeatureType, spec)* if found,
which returns a FeatureDataset. Currently only a limited number of Point
Feature tyeps are supported. This is an experimental feature.

== NcML referenced datasets

NcML datasets typically reference other CDM datasets, using the
_location_ attribute of the _netcdf_ element, for example:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2" 
     location="file:/dev/netcdf-java-2.2/test/data/example1.nc">
...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The location is passed to ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset.openFile(), and
so can be any valid CDM dataset location. In addition, an NcML
referenced dataset location can be reletive to the NcML file or the
working directory:

* A relative URL resolved against the NcML location (eg
**subdir/mydata.nc**). You must *not* use a _file:_ prefix in this case.
* An absolute file URL with a relative path (eg **file:data/mine.nc**).
The file will be opened relative to the working directory.

There are a few subtle differences between using a location in NcML and
passing a location to the NetcdfDataset.openFile() and related methods:

1.  _*In NcML, you MUST always use forward slashes*_ in your paths, even
when on a Windows machine. For example: *file:C:/data/mine.nc.*
NetcdfFile.open() will accept backslashes on a Windows machine.
2.  In NcML, a relative URL is resolved against the NcML location. In
NetcdfFile.open(), it is interpreted as relative to the working
directory.

== NcML scan location

NcML aggregation _*scan*_ elements use the location attribute to specify
which directory to find files in, for example: +

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
  <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
 <scan location="/data/model/" suffix=".nc" />
  </aggregation>
</netcdf>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Allowable forms of the location for the scan directory are:

* _*/usr/share/data/*_
* _*file:/usr/share/data/*_
* _*file:C:/share/data/model.nc*_ *(NOTE we advise using forward slashes
everywhere, including Windows)*
* _*data/model.nc*_ (relative to the NcML directory)
* _*file:data/model.nc*_ (relative to the current working directory)

When using a directory location that has an embedded `:' char, eg
__*C:/share/data/model.nc*__, its a really good idea to add the file:
prefix, to prevent the `C:' from being misinterpreted as a URI schema.
Future versions of NcML may use URIs for the location.

Common mistakes:

* <scan location="**D:\work\agg**" suffix=``.nc'' /> in a Windows
machine will try to scan *D:/work/agg/D:/work/agg* . Use <scan
location="**D:/work/agg**" suffix=``.nc'' />, or better <scan
location="**file:D:/work/agg**" suffix=``.nc'' /> +
