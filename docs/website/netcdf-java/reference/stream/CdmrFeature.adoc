CDM Remote is a web service implemented in the CDM library (client) and TDS (server), providing remote access to CDM feature datasets, using
link:NcStream.html[ncstream] as the on-the-wire protocol. It provides access at the NetcdfFile and FeatureDataset levels of the CDM API, so there are
two levels of services:

1.  *link:CdmRemote.html[CdmRemote]* provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets, with the same functionality that *NetcdfFile* provides for
CDM local datasets and *DODSNetcdfFile* provides for remote OPeNDAP datasets. CdmRemote supports the full CDM data model.
2.  *CdmrFeature* provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Feature Datasets, with similar functionality to WCS and
Unidata's link:../../../tds/reference/services/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.html[_NetCDF Subset Service_] __(NCSS)__. This API and protocol is redone
in version 5.0.

The CDM Remote services and protocol are experimental and should not be used outside of the CDM stack for now.

The client creates requests of the form **endpoint?query**, where _endpoint_ is the URL of a CdmrFeature service, and _query_ is one or more *_key=value_* parameters, as described below.

Example request:

---------------------------
http://thredds-dev.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/cdmrfeature/grid/grib/NCEP/GFS/Global_0p5deg/Best?req=data&var=Albedo_surface_Mixed_intervals_Average
---------------------------

See link:CdmrfGrammer.adoc[CdmrFeature Grammer] for a description of the on-the-wire protocol.
