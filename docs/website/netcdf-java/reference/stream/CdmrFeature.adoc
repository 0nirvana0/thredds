= CdmrFeature Web Service
:tdsDocs: ../../../tds/reference/services

CDM Remote is a web service implemented in the CDM library (client) and TDS (server), providing remote access to CDM feature datasets, using
link:NcStream.adoc[ncstream] as the on-the-wire protocol. It provides access at the NetcdfFile and FeatureDataset levels of the CDM API, so there are
two levels of services:

1.  *link:CdmRemote.adoc[CdmRemote]* provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets, with the same functionality that *NetcdfFile* provides for
CDM local datasets and *DODSNetcdfFile* provides for remote OPeNDAP datasets. CdmRemote supports the full CDM data model.
2.  *CdmrFeature* provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Feature Datasets, with similar functionality to WCS and
Unidata's link:{tdsDocs}/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.adoc[NetCDF Subset Service] (NCSS). This API and protocol is redone
in version 5.0.

The CDM Remote services and protocol are experimental and should not be used outside of the CDM stack for now.

== CDM Remote Feature

This web service is available from THREDDS Data Servers for *Coverage feature Types* (_GRID, SWATH, FMRC_) and *Point Feature Types*
(_Point, Station, Trajectory, etc).

The client creates requests of the form *endpoint?query*, where _endpoint_ is the URL of a CdmrFeature service, and _query_ is one or more *_key=value_* parameters, as described below.

Example request:

----
http://thredds-dev.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/cdmrfeature/grid/grib/NCEP/GFS/Global_0p5deg/Best?req=data&var=Albedo_surface_Mixed_intervals_Average
----

See link:CdmrfGrammer.adoc[CdmrFeature Grammer] for a description of the on-the-wire protocol.
