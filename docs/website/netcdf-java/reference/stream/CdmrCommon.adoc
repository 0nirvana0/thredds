CDM Remote is a web service implemented in the CDM library (client) and TDS (server), providing remote access to CDM datasets, using
<<NcStream.adoc,ncstream>> as the on-the-wire protocol.
It provides access at the NetcdfFile and FeatureDataset levels of the CDM API, so there are two levels of services:

.  *<<CdmRemote.adoc,CDM Remote>>* provides index subsetting on remote CDM datasets, with the same functionality that *NetcdfFile* provides for
CDM local datasets and *DODSNetcdfFile* provides for remote OPeNDAP datasets. CdmRemote supports the full CDM data model.
.  *<<CdmrFeatureGrid.adoc,CDM Remote Feature for Coverage/Grid Data>>* provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Coverage (Grid) Feature Datasets, with similar functionality to WCS and
Unidata's <<{tdsDocs}/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.adoc,NetCDF Subset Service>> (NCSS).
.  *<<CdmrFeaturePoint.adoc,CDM Remote Feature for Point Data>>* provides coordinate subsetting on remote CDM Point (DSG) Feature Datasets, with similar functionality to
Unidata's <<{tdsDocs}/NetcdfSubsetServiceReference.adoc,NetCDF Subset Service>> (NCSS).

This API and protocol is available in TDS/CDM version >= 5.0.
