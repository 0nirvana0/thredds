== Disk Caching

=== Writing temporary files using DiskCache

There are a number of places where the CDM library needs to write
temporary files to disk. If you end up using the file more than once,
its useful to save these files. The CDM uses static methods in
*ucar.nc2.util.DiskCache* to manage how the temporary files are managed.

Before the CDM writes the temporary file, it looks to see if it already
exists.

1.  If a filename ends with "**.Z**``, ''**.zip**``, ''**.gzip**``,
''**.gz**``, or ''**.bz2**", *NetcdfFile.open* will write an
uncompressed file of the same name, but without the suffix.
2.  *Nexrad2, Cinrad2* files that are compressed will be uncompressed to
a file with an *.uncompress* prefix.

By default, DiskCache prefers to place the temporary file in the same
directory as the original file. If it does not have write permission in
that directory, by default it will use the directory
*$\{user_home}/.unidata/cache/.* You can change the directory by calling

__________________________________________________________
*ucar.nc2.util.DiskCache.setRootDirectory(rootDirectory).*
__________________________________________________________

You might want to always write temporary files to the cache directory,
in order to manage them in a central place. To do so, call

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*ucar.nc2.util.DiskCache.setCachePolicy( boolean alwaysInCache)* with
parameter **alwaysInCache = true**.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

You may want to limit the amount of space the disk cache uses (unless
you always have data in writeable directories, so that the disk cache is
never used). To scour the cache, call **DiskCache.cleanCache**(). There
are several variations of the cleanup:

* *DiskCache.cleanCache(Date cutoff, StringBuilder sbuff)* will delete
files older than the cutoff date.
* *DiskCache.cleanCache(long maxBytes, StringBuilder sbuff)* will retain
maxBytes bytes, deleting oldest files first.
* *DiskCache.cleanCache(long maxBytes, Comparator<File> fileComparator,
StringBuilder sbuff)* will retain maxBytes bytes, deleting files in the
order defined by your Comparator.

For long running appplication, you might want to do this periodically in
a background timer thread, as in the following example.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance(); // contains current startup time
   c.add( Calendar.MINUTE, 30); // add 30 minutes to current time     // run task every 60 minutes, starting 30 minutes from now
2) java.util.Timer timer = new Timer();
    timer.scheduleAtFixedRate( new CacheScourTask(), c.getTime(), (long) 1000 * 60 * 60 );

3) private class CacheScourTask extends java.util.TimerTask {   
    public void run() {
     StringBuffer sbuff = new StringBuffer();
4) DiskCache.cleanCache(100 * 1000 * 1000, sbuff); // 100 Mbytes
     sbuff.append("----------------------\n");
5)   log.info(sbuff.toString());
    }
   }
   ...
   // upon exiting
6) timer.cancel();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Get the current time and add 30 minutes to it
2.  Start up a timer that executes every 60 minutes, starting in 30
minutes
3.  Your class must extend TimerTask, the run method is called by the
Timer
4.  Scour the cache, allowing 100 Mbytes of space to be retained
5.  Optionally log a message with the results of the scour.
6.  Make sure you cancel the timer before your application exits, or
else the process will not terminate.

=== Writing temporary files using DiskCache2

In a number of places, the *ucar.nc2.util.DiskCache2* class is used to
control caching. This does not use static methods, so can be configured
for each individual use.

The default constructor mimics DiskCache, using
*$\{user_home}/.unidata/cache/* as the root directory:

____________________________________
*DiskCache2 dc2 = new DiskCache2();*
____________________________________

You can change the root directory by calling

______________________________________
*dc2.setRootDirectory(rootDirectory).*
______________________________________

You can tell the class to scour itself in a background timer by using
the constructor:

_____________________________________________________________________
*DiskCache2 dc2 = new DiskCache2(rootDirectory, false, 24 * 60, 60);*
_____________________________________________________________________

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Create a cache on disk.
 * @param root the root directory of the cache. Must be writeable.
 * @param reletiveToHome if the root directory is reletive to the cache home directory.
 * @param persistMinutes  a file is deleted if its last modified time is greater than persistMinutes
 * @param scourEveryMinutes how often to run the scour process. If <= 0, dont scour.
 */
 public DiskCache2(String root, boolean reletiveToHome, int persistMinutes, int scourEveryMinutes);
       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can change the cache policy from the default
**CachePathPolicy**.*OneDirectory* by (eg):

_______________________________________________________________
*dc2.setCachePathPolicy(CachePathPolicy.NestedTruncate, null).*
_______________________________________________________________

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  /**
   * Set the cache path policy
   * @param cachePathPolicy one of:
   *   OneDirectory (default) : replace "/" with "-", so all files are in one directory.
   *   NestedDirectory: cache files are in nested directories under the root.
   *   NestedTruncate: eliminate leading directories
   *
   * @param cachePathPolicyParam for NestedTruncate, eliminate this string
   */
  public void setCachePathPolicy(CachePathPolicy cachePathPolicy, String cachePathPolicyParam);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can ensure that the cache is always used with:

_______________________________
*dc2.setCacheAlwaysUsed(true);*
_______________________________

Otherwise, the cache will try to write the temporary file in the same
directory as the data file, and only use the cache if that directory is
not writeable.

== GRIB Indexing and Caching

In 4.3 and above, for each GRIB file the CDM writes a _grib index file_
using the filename plus suffix **.gbx9**. So a file named
*filename.grib1* will have an index file *filename.grib1.gbx9* created
for it the first time that its read. Usually a _cdm index file_ is also
created, using the filename plus suffix **.ncx**. So a file named
*filename.grib1* will have an index file *filename.grib1.ncx* created
for it the first time. When a GRIB file is only part of a collection of
GRIB files, then the ncx file may be created only for the collection.

The location of these index files is controlled by a _caching strategy._
The default strategy is to try to place the index files in the same
directory as the data file. If that directory is not writeable, then the
default strategy is to write the index files in the __default caching
directory__. In a client application using the CDM, that default will be

________________________________
*$\{user_home}/.unidata/cache/.*
________________________________

On the TDS it will be

___________________________________________
*$\{tomcat_home}/content/thredds/cache/cdm*
___________________________________________

Clients of the CDM can change the ****GRIB caching behavior by
configuring a link:#DiskCache2[DiskCache2] and calling:

____________________________________________________________
*ucar.nc2.grib.GribCollection.setDiskCache2(DiskCache2 dc);*
____________________________________________________________

== Object Caching

=== NetcdfFileCache

NetcdfFile objects are cached in memory for performance. When acquired,
the object is locked so another thread cannot use. When closed, the lock
is removed. When the cache is full, older objects are removed from the
cache, and all resources released.

Note that typically a *java.io.RandomAccessFile* object, holding an OS
file handle, is open while its in the cache. You must make sure that
your cache size is not so large such that you run out of file handles
due to NetcdfFile object caching. Most aggregations do not hold more
than one file handle open, no matter how many files are in the
aggregation. The exception to that is a Union aggregation, which holds
each of the files in the union open for the duration of the NetcdfFile
object.

Holding a file handle open also creates a read lock on some operating
systems, which will prevent the file from being opened in write mode.

To enable caching, you must first call

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NetcdfDataset.initNetcdfFileCache(int minElementsInMemory, int maxElementsInMemory, int period);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where _minElementsInMemory_ are the number of objects to keep in the
cache when cleaning up, _maxElementsInMemory_ triggers a cleanup if the
cache size goes over it, and _period_ specifies the time in seconds to
do periodic cleanups.

After enabling, you can disable with:

---------------------------------------
NetcdfDataset.disableNetcdfFileCache();
---------------------------------------

However, you cant reenable after disabling.

Setting *minElementsInMemory* to zero will remove all files not
currently in use every *period* seconds.

Normally the cleanup is done is a background thread to not interferre
with your application, and the maximum elements is approximate. When
resources such as file handles must be carefully managed, you can set a
hard limit with this call:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   NetcdfDataset.initNetcdfFileCache(int minElementsInMemory, int maxElementsInMemory, int hardLimit, int period);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so that as soon as the number of NetcdfFile objects exceeds _hardLimit_
, a cleanup is done immediately in the calling thread.
