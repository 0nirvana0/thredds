NetCDF Markup Language
======================

= *The NetCDF Markup Language (NcML)*

'''''

== Overview

NcML is an XML representation of netCDF metadata, (approximately) the
header information one gets from a netCDF file with the ``ncdump -h''
command. NcML is similar to the netCDF
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/guidec/guidec-15.html#HEADING15-0[CDL]
(network Common data form Description Language), except, of course, it
uses XML syntax.

NcML development is happening on two fronts:

1.  link:#NcML22[NcML-2.2] as implemented by the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/index.html[NetCDF-Java
library.]
2.  http://zeus.pin.unifi.it/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=50&Itemid=78%20[ncML-Gml]
is an extension of ncML core schema, based on GML grammar. It uses both
NcML and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language[GML] to
create a bridge to GIS Systems. This work is led by

== NcML 2.2

=== NcML as output

The simplest use of NcML is to describe the metadata and structural
content of a netCDF file, like the output of **ncdump -h**. There are
several ways to generate NcML ouput from an existing netCDF file:

1.  In the
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[ToolsUI]
application, use the NcML tab to open a NetCDF dataset, and the NcML
will be displayed. You can edit and then save the NcML with the **"Save
NcML**" button.
2.  In the NetCDF-Java library, use *NetcdfFile.writeNcML()* or
*NcMLWriter().writeXML().*
3.  Use the NetCDF-Java library
file:///C|/dev/github/thredds/docs/web/netcdf-java/site/reference/manPages.html#ncdump[ncdump
application], eg:
+
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 java -classpath netcdfAll.jar ucar.nc2.NCdumpW <NetCDF-3 filename> -ncml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  In the netCDF C library, version 3.6.1 or later , use *ncdump
-x<NetCDF filename>*

=== Using NcML to create a NetCDF-3 file

Using the NetCDF-Java library, you can also use NcML to create a new
netCDF-3 file, similar to the *ncgen* program.

1.  Using a text or XML editor, create the NcML file with an ``xml'' or
``ncml'' file extension. Open the NcML file with
**NetcdfDataset.open()**, then call *ucar.nc2.FileWriter.writeFile()*
2.  In the
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[ToolsUI]
application, open an existing NcML file in the NcML tab, or create a new
one. You can edit and save the NcML with the **"Save NcML**" button. You
can create the equivilent binary NetCDF file with the **"Write NetCDF**"
button.

=== Using NcML to modify an existing CDM file

Using the NetCDF-Java library, you can use NcML to modify an existing
CDM file, and then write a new netCDF-3 format file with those
modifications in it.

1.  Using a text or XML editor, create the NcML file with an ``xml'' or
``ncml'' file extension. Reference the existing file using the
_location_ attribute, and add, change or delete metadata in the NcML as
in this link:Tutorial.html#modify[example].
2.  Write the new file as a netCDF-3 format file:
1.  Use the NetCDF-Java library
file:///C|/dev/github/thredds/docs/web/netcdf-java/site/reference/manPages.html#nccopy[nccopy
application] to write the new file, eg:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
java -Xmx1g -classpath netcdfAll-4.3.jar ucar.nc2.dataset.NetcdfDataset -in myFile.ncml -out myFile.nc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  (or) In the
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[ToolsUI]
application, open the NcML file in the NcML tab. You can create the
equivilent binary NetCDF file with the **"Write NetCDF**" button.

=== Advanced NcML

A more advanced use is to modify existing NetCDF files, as well as to
create ``virtual'' NetCDF datasets, for example through aggregation. In
that case, you’ll have to read more:

* link:Tutorial.html[Tutorial]
* link:Aggregation.html[Aggregation]
* link:Cookbook.html[Cookbook Examples]
* link:AnnotatedSchema4.html[Annotated Schema for Netcdf-Java 4]

== *Acknowledgments and History*

Earlier work in defining XML representations for netCDF data included
Bear Giles DTD and XML tools in March 2000, a proposed DTD by Stefano
Nativi and Lorenzo Bigagli at the University of Florence in May 2000,
and a version developed by John Caron in February 2001.

The original NcML working group consisted of John Caron (Unidata/UCAR),
Luca Cinquini (SCD/NCAR), Ethan Davis (Unidata/UCAR), Bob Drach
(PCMDI/LLNL), Stefano Nativi (University of Florence), and Russ Rew
(Unidata/UCAR).

In the first implementation of NcML (version 2.1), there were three
parts to NcML with separate schema documents:

1.  *_NcML Core Schema_* represented the existing netCDF-3 data model
2.  *_NcML Coordinate System_* extended NcML Core Schema and extended
the netCDF data model to add explicit support for general and
georeferencing coordinate systems
3.  _*NcML Dataset*_ extended NcML Core Schema to use NcML to define a
netCDF file, similar to the *ncgen* command line tool, as well as to
redefine, aggregate, and subset existing netCDF files.

*_NcML Coordinate System_* is now superceded by
link:#ncML-Gml[NcML-GML.] *_NcML Core Schema_* and _*NcML Dataset*_ have
been combined into a single __*link:#NcML22[NcML Schema]*__, and some of
the _*NcML Dataset*_ syntax and functionality has been modified.
