=== _ChunkSize

A Variable Attribute indicating what chunking to use to store the data
in a file. Used when writing netCDF-4 files. When an HDF5/ netCDF-4 is
read, this attribute is added to the variable’s metadata.

=== *_Compress*

A Variable Attribute indicating if compression should be used when
writing the variable. Used when writing netCDF-4 files and for ncstream.
Currently the only valid value of the attribute is "**deflate**",
indicating to use the deflate compression algorithm.

=== _Unsigned

The existence of this Variable Attribute means that a Variable’s data is
unsigned. Only used only for byte, short, and int data types. The value
of the attribute is ignored, but by convention, should be set to
**true**.
