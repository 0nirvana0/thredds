CDM/OPeNDAP
===========

= CDM – OPeNDAP Interface

When the CDM reads an OPeNDAP dataset, it makes the following
transformations:

________________________________________________
*OPeNDAP* *primitive              CDM primitive*

* the ___Unsigned__ attribute is set

==== OPeNDAP Attributes

An OPeNDAP Attribute may be a name/value pair, or may contain other
attributes, in which case it is called an __attribute container__.
Containers may be nested. The CDM first matches OPeNDAP attribute
containers against Variable names. On a match, the attributes become the
Variable’s attributes. Anything that doesn’t match is made into a global
Variable. The CDM does not support nested attributes, so these are
flattened by using a ``.'' to separate the container(s) from the name.

Certain OPeNDAP attribute containers are handled separately. An
attribute named _*NC_GLOBAL*_ or _*HDF_GLOBAL*_ is assumed to contain
global attributes. Attribute containers named _*DODS_EXTRA*_ and
_*EXTRA_DIMENSION*_ are handled as described in the next section.

==== OPeNDAP Dimensions

OPeNDAP (version 2) does not have explicit shared Dimensions in its
object model, except for Map arrays inside of Grids. NetCDF has only
shared Dimensions, while the CDM data model allows for both shared and
private (non-shared) Dimensions. A shared CDM dimension always has a
name, while a private CDM Dimension may or may not be named.

Unnamed OPeNDAP Dimensions are mapped to anonymous (private, unnamed)
CDM Dimensions. Named OPeNDAP Dimensions are made into shared CDM
Dimensions, in the order they are found in the DDS. If a shared
Dimension with the same name already exists, and it has a different
length, a named OPeNDAP Dimension is made into a private, named CDM
Dimension. Because DAP 2 doesn’t have groups, all shared Dimensions will
be global. This effectively means that we assume that OPeNDAP Dimensions
of the same name and length are the same object.

In order to get the full semantics of NetCDF files transported across
the OPeNDAP protocol, we use 2 special global attributes. If there is a
global attribute called _*DODS_EXTRA/Unlimited_Dimension*_ then the
value of that attribute is assumed to be a dimension name, which is then
set to be an _Unlimited_ dimension. If there is a global attribute
called _*EXTRA_DIMENSION,*_ then it contains one or more (name, length)
attributes which are made into shared CDM Dimensions. This allows a
server to pass dimensions which are not used in a Variable, but
conceivably might be needed by a client. Here are examples of these two
cases:

-------------------------------------------------------
    DODS_EXTRA { String Unlimited_Dimension record; }  
-------------------------------------------------------

_DODS_EXTRA_ and _EXTRA_DIMENSION_ are ad-hoc Conventions used only by
the TDS as far as I know.

==== OPeNDAP Grids

An OPeNDAP Grid object is decomposed into different Variables for the
data array and for each map vector in the Grid. The map vectors are
placed at the global level, in the order they are found in the DDS. If a
map vector already exists, then it is assumed to be identical with the
existing one. Dimensions are currently not checked. For both maps and
arrays, the containing grid name is discarded. These assumptions
preserve the semantics of NetCDF datasets, but are a violation of the
OPeNDAP specification in which Grids constitute a separate namespace.
Trying to preserve the namespace makes Netcdf datasets incorrect. This
is one of the most important incompatibilities of the NetCDF and OPeNDAP
data models, since there is not workaround for DAP 2.

In order to preserve the semantics of the map vectors, the following CDM
attribute is added to the data variable:

-------------------------------------
 _Coordinate.Axes = "map1 map2 map3";
-------------------------------------

The CDM Coordinate System layer uses this to associate the array and map
Variables, as intended by the Grid specification

==== OPeNDAP Strings

The default case is to map OPeNDAP Strings to CDM Strings. If the
Variable has an attribute named _*DODS/strlen*_ , then the CDM instead
uses DataType.CHAR. The value of the _*DODS/strlen*_ attribute is the
length of the innermost dimension. For example, an OPeNDAP String of
dimension (5, 7) becomes a char Variable of dimension (5,7,strlen). If
the Variable has an attribute named __*DODS/dimName*__, then dimName
becomes the dimension name of the inner Dimension, otherwise the
Dimension is anonymous.

Some older OPeNDAP servers that read NetCDF files map multidimensional
char arrays to multidimensional String arrays, with each String being
length 1. As a workaround, the CDM reads the data for all String
variables from an OPeNDAP dataset when the dataset is opened. If it
discovers that the data consists of Strings of length 1, it changes the
Variable dataType to DataType.CHAR. In any case, we cache the String
data on the client. This workaround is reasonable as long as there isn’t
huge amounts of String data in the dataset.

==== OPeNDAP Sequences

An OPeNDAP Sequence is mapped to a one-dimensional CDM Structure of
variable length (uses Dimension.VLEN). The CDM now has a Sequence class,
but we have not yet converted the CDM opendap code to use it. The
semantics of both are the same, the user is only allowed to read the
entire sequence (no subsetting). In the general API (ie through the
NetcdfFile interface), constraint expressions are not supported .
However, a user could break encapsulation and call
_*DODSNetcdfFile.readWithCE()*_ to read data with a relational
constraint expression on a Sequence.
